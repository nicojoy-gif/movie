How to run the project locally 
Clone the Project (if not already done):

1. If you haven't already, you'll need to clone the fully developed React project from a version control system like Git or obtain the project source code from wherever it's hosted (e.g., a ZIP file). Navigate to the project directory in your terminal/command prompt.
git clone <repository_url>

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

Change your current working directory to the root folder of your fully developed React project:
cd your-project-directory

3. Install Dependencies:

Before running the project, you need to install its dependencies. In most React projects, this is done using npm or yarn. Use one of the following commands based on your preference:
npm install
# OR
yarn install


4. Start the Development Server:

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:
npm start
# OR
yarn start
This command will start the local development server and open your fully developed React project in a web browser. By default, it runs on port 3000, so you can access your app at http://localhost:3000/.

5. Edit and Test:

You can now edit, test, and interact with your fully developed React project locally. Any changes you make to the code will automatically trigger a hot-reload so that you can see the results in your browser immediately.
